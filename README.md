Case-sensitive and case-insensitve routines, both UTF-8-tested, for matching wildcards

Matching Wildcards In Swift

This file set includes UTF-8-tested routines for matching wildcards in Swift (fastwildcompare.swift), based on the C/C++ implementation here: https://developforperformance.com/MatchingWildcards_AnImprovedAlgorithmForBigData.html

It also includes Swift implementations of ASCII testcases for correctness and performance, also originally implemented in C/C++, plus a new set of UTF-8 testcases originally implemented in Rust.

A description of the implementation and testing strategies and performance findingsr appear here: https://developforperformance.com/MatchingWildcardsUTF8ReadyInGoSwiftAndCpp.html#MatchingWildcardsInSwift
